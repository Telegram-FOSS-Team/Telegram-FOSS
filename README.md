## Telegram-FOSS

[Telegram](http://telegram.org) is a messaging app with a focus on speed and security. It’s superfast, simple and free.
This repo contains the official source code for [Telegram App for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.telegram.messenger).

This is an unofficial, FOSS friendly fork of the original [Telegram App for Android](https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram).

Import the root folder into your IDE (tested on Android Studio), then run project.
